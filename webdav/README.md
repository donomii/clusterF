## WebDAV Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented WebDAV support for the clusterF filesystem. Here's what was added:

### Files Created:
1. `/webdav/clusterfilesystem.go` - WebDAV filesystem adapter for the cluster
2. `/webdav/server.go` - WebDAV server implementation
3. `/webdav/go.mod` - Module definition for the webdav package

### Key Features:
- **Command Line Option**: `--webdav /path/prefix` serves a specific cluster path over WebDAV
- **Full WebDAV Interface**: Implements all required WebDAV operations:
  - `Open` - Read files
  - `Stat` - Get file/directory metadata
  - `ReadDir` - List directory contents
  - `Create` - Upload/create files
  - `RemoveAll` - Delete files/directories
  - `Mkdir` - Create directories
  - `Copy` - Copy files/directories
  - `Move` - Move/rename files/directories

### Path Filtering:
- When `--webdav /photos` is specified, only cluster files under `/photos` are served
- Local WebDAV paths are mapped to cluster paths with the prefix
- Example: WebDAV `/vacation/photo.jpg` â†’ cluster `/photos/vacation/photo.jpg`

### Integration:
- Added WebDAV module to main go.mod with proper replace directive
- Updated main.go to accept `--webdav` flag and start WebDAV server on port 8080
- Updated status message to show WebDAV server information
- Extended FileSystemLike interface to support additional methods needed by WebDAV

### Usage:
```bash
# Serve entire cluster over WebDAV
./clusterF --webdav ""

# Serve only /photos path prefix over WebDAV  
./clusterF --webdav "/photos"

# Access via WebDAV client at http://localhost:8080
```

### WebDAV Client Support:
- Works with any WebDAV client (macOS Finder, Windows Explorer, davfs2, etc.)
- Supports file upload, download, directory creation, move/copy operations
- Proper content-type detection and ETag support for caching

The implementation provides a clean bridge between the cluster's distributed filesystem and standard WebDAV clients, allowing seamless integration with existing file management tools.
